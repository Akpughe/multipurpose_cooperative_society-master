              <div class="card-text"><p>Our treatment philosophy was a long overdue revelation, and now many other centers are trying to emulate our successful formula. If you are researching other options, you should be diligent and thorough as most addiction treatment programs out there still subscribe to the disease concept and rely heavily on group meetings.</p>

                <p>Anyone who is abusing drugs and alcohol is doing so because of one or more of these four causes. Through extensive research and direct experience, we have learned that addiction is not the primary problem but rather the symptom of a deeper underlying issue.</p><br/><br/>
